This is a document to provide the rationale for decisions that are made
regarding the use of buildroot.


ON 10-16-2014 It was decided to use glibc instead of uclib because
glibc is in wider use and so therefore is likely better tested.  It 
was also decided to use it on the strength of it not really impacting 
the size of the root file system all that much.
